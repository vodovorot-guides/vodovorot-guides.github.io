## Shriekwing

**Boss Fight Profile:** Single-Target

**Talents:**
- 2 - EotE
- 2/3 - EcS or EB
- 1/2 - SW or ES
- 1 - MotE
- 3 - WRT
- 3 - IF
- 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence
- Elemental Equilibrium

**Damage:**
- Utilize Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts if targeted with Echolocation.
- If possible, pool Maelstrom on Shriekwing during Phase 2, but do not be reckless for it.

**Defensives:**
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} for Bloodcurdling Shriek and Reverberating Scream as needed.
- Spirit Wolf can help your survivability during intermission. Earth Shield can offer HPS against the constant damage from Reverberating Scream.

**Healing:**
- Phase 2 is a great opportunity to support your raid with off-healing through Healing Stream Totem, Chain Heal, and Healing Surge as needed.

**Utilities:**
- If talented, use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help raid members with Echolocation, Echoing Shreek, or throughout Phase 2.

**Notes:**
- The damage patterns for this fight are either small trickles or very lethal. As such, {{ site.data.talent.natures_guardian }} may not prove useful, and {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} will offer better survivability for you and your raid.
- Because Sonar Shriek is a Horrify and not a Fear, you cannot use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to dispel players.

**Healing:**
- On Mythic difficulty, utilize your healing abilities as needed to keep yourself and nearby members healthy for the impending Pierced Soul adds when soaking Sinseeker during Bargast.

**Utilities:**

**Notes:**
- From beta testing, Shades of Bargast gained additional Destabilize stacks for each unique crowd control effect on them. If intended, then use {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem}} on them as well.

## Artificer Xy'mox

**Boss Fight Profile:** Single-Target / Spread Cleave

**Talents:**
* 2 - EotE
* 2 - EcS
* 1/2 - SW/ES
* 1 - MotE
* 3 - WRT
* 3 - IF
* 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence
- Elemental Equilibrium

**Damage:**
- This is a very movement heavy fight, so be proactive with your instant casts and use Spiritwalker's Grace liberally.

**Defensives:**
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for Glyph of Destruction and Seed of Extinction.
- Spirit Wolf allows you to better navigate the mechanics from each relic. Earth Shield can offer HPS against constant damage (i.e. Hyperlight Spark, Glyph of Destruction, Withering Touch, and Aura of Dread).

**Utilities:**
- If talented, use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help raid members place Dimensional Tears, move Seeds of Extinction, and avoid Edge of Annihilation.

**Notes:**
- Because the Possession from Fleeting Spirits is a mind control and not a Charm, you cannot use {{site.data.spell.tremor_totem}} to dispel players.

## Hungering Destroyer

**Boss Fight Profile:** Single-Target

**Talents:**
* 2 - EotE
* 2/3 - EcS/EB
* 1 - SW
* 1 - MotE
* 1/3 - NG/WRT
* 3 - IF
* 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence
- Elemental Equilibrium

**Damage:**
- Utilize Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts when spreading for Volatile Ejection and running from Consume.

**Defensives:**
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for any overlapping mechanics between Gluttonous Miasma, Expunge, and Desolate.
- If talented, Spirit Wolf can be used to mitigate Consume when you are out of range of the boss, and the increased movement speed will improve your Expunge placements.

**Healing:**
- Make sure you are healthy before Expunge is cast. Support your raid members with off-healing if any are dangerously low.

**Utilities:**
- If talented, use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help raid members position Volatile Ejection or run away from Consume.

**Notes:**
- Remember that when you are affected by Gluttonous Miasma, Earth Shield and {{ site.data.talent.natures_guardian }} will not be useful if talented.

* 1/2 - SW/ES
* 1 - MotE

* 2 - PE
* 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence
- Echoes of Great Sundering

**Damage:**

- Use Earthquake when 2+ targets are together. Use {{ site.data.spell.chain_lightning }} when 3+ targets are together.

- Utilize Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts as needed when targeted with Shared Suffering.

**Defensives:**
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for Change of Heart and Bottled Anima vials.
- Spirit Wolf can be used to mitigate damage from Loose Anima (if channeling) or to run out and soak far away Bottled Anima vials. Earth Shield can offer you HPS because of the constant damage from Loose Anima.

**Utilities:**
- Interrupt Condemn as assigned.

**Notes:**
- Because Shaman have the lowest CD interrupt, two Shaman and a tank make an ideal interrupt rotation for a Conjured Manifestation add.
- If using Primal Earth Elemental for {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}}, make sure it is not picking up adds and interfering with your tanks.

## The Council of Blood

**Boss Fight Profile:** Single-Target / Funnel

* 2 - EotE
* 2 - EcS
* 1/2 - SW/ES
* 1 - MotE
* 1/3 - NG/WRT
* 2 - PE
* 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Skybreaker's Fiery Demise
- Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence

**Damage:**
- Maintain {{ site.data.spell.flame_shock }} on as many targets as possible.
- During the Danse Macabre, the bosses are still targetable even with 99% damage reduction. Continue maintaining {{ site.data.spell.flame_shock }}. If Skybreaker's Fiery Demise is equipped, this will especially be a major boon.
- Utilize Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts as needed for Anima Fountain, Waltz of Blood, Dark Recital, and Dancing Fever (on Mythic difficulty).

**Defensives:**
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for Dark Recital or as mechanics become overwhelming with increasing damage from Oppressive Atmosphere.
- Spirit Wolf can help you move quickly or mitigate damage from Scarlet Letter, Unstoppable Charge, Castellan's Cadre, and Dancing Fools. Earth Shield can offer you HPS against the constant damage from Oppressive Atmosphere alone.

**Utilities:**
- Interrupt Bolt of Power from Baroness Frieda as assigned.

- If talented, use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help raid members position for Danse Macabre, Anima Fountain, Waltz of Blood.

## Sludgefist

**Boss Fight Profile:** Single-Target

**Talents:**
* 2 - EotE
* 2 - EcS
* 1/2 - SW/ES

* 1/3 - NG/WRT
* 3 - IF
* 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence
- Elemental Equilibrium

**Damage:**
- Destructive Impact occurs nearly every minute. If Stormkeeper is talented, it is a good idea to line up the cast with each Destructive Impact.
- Utilize Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts as needed for Destructive Stomp, Falling Rubble, Chain Slam, and Seismic Shift (on Mythic difficulty).

**Defensives:**
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed for Colossal Roar and Destructive Impact.
- Because you will take constant damage from Chain Link and Collapsing Foundation, Earth Shield is a good talent option for HPS.

**Utilities:**
- If talented, use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help raid members position out of Destructive Stomp or Falling Rubble.

**Notes:**
- Because of the Chain Link mechanic, be careful about your time spent in Ghost Wolf, especially if you are paired with a player less mobile.

- Because you may take constant damage from Wicked Laceration and Heart Rend, Earth Shield is a good talent option for HPS.

**Utilities:**
- If talented, use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help raid members running for Stonegale Effigy or Shattering Blast.

**Notes:**
- If using Primal Earth Elemental for {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}}, make sure it is not picking up adds and interfering with your tanks.

## Sire Denathrius

**Boss Fight Profile:** ST / Cleave / Spread Cleave

**Talents:**
* 2 - EotE
* 2 - EcS
* 1/2 - SW/ES
* 1 - MotE
* 3 - WRT
* 1/2 - IF/PE
* 2 - SK

**Potential Legendaries:**
- Skybreaker's Fiery Demise
- Echoes of Great Sundering

**Damage:**
Phase 1:
- Pool Maelstrom for Echo of Sin adds. If talented, hold Stormkeeper for them as well.
- Use Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts as needed when targeted by Feeding Time (Night Hunter on Heroic/Mythic).

Phase 2:
- Maintain {{ site.data.spell.flame_shock }} on Sire Denathrius, Remornia, and any additional adds as you can.
- Use Earthquake when 2+ targets are together. Use {{ site.data.spell.chain_lightning }} when 3+ targets are together.
- Depending on timings, you may pool Maelstrom and hold CDs to optimize the Wracking Pain debuff on enemies.

Phase 3:
- Use Spiritwalker's Grace or instant casts as needed when targeted by Fatal Finesse and soaking Smoldering Ire.

**Defensives:**
Phase 1:
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} and {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}} (if PE talented) as needed for Feeding Time (Night Hunter on Heroic/Mythic), Blood Price, or Cleansing Pain.

Phase 2:
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} and {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}} (if PE talented) as needed for Impale or increasing Crimson Chorus stacks.

Phase 3:
- Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} and {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}} (if PE talented) as needed for Fatal Finesse or Smoldering Ire.

\---
- This encounter is very movement demanding, so the additional movement from Spirit Wolf can be beneficial in each phase. Burden of Sin, Carnage, Crimson Chorus, and Fatal Finesse are all constant sources of damage that can allow HPS from Earth Shield.

**Healing:**
Intermission:
- As you will likely make it ahead of your raid during March of the Penitent, it is a good opportunity to briefly off-heal your fellow raid members after your Burden of Sin stacks drop.

**Utilities:**
Phase 1:
- Use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help your raid position out of Ravage.

Phase 2:
- Use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help your raid avoid Massacre and Hand of Destruction.

Phase 3:
- Use {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }} as needed to help your raid members navigate Shattering Pain, Hand of Destruction, Ravage, and Massacre.

**Notes:**
- Because of Ghost Wolf, you will not be slowed during March of the Penitent in Phase 1, but you must be in Ghost Wolf form before the phase begins. Consider not clearing any Burden of Sin stacks during this phase.
- If using Primal Earth Elemental for {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}}, make sure it is not picking up adds and interfering with your tanks.

# Miscellaneous Tips
- GCDs spent on healing and utilities are GCDs not spent on damage, but both are necessary to down a raid boss. Find the balance to optimize your contributions to your raid team.

- Time spent in Ghost Wolf is time spent not doing damage. Practice proactive movement and utilizing Spiritwalker's Grace and instant casts as much as you can for movement heavy encounters.

- When talenting Primal Elementalist, always remember you have an additional defensive ({{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}}) and single target stun (Pulverize) through Earth Elemental.

- Recall that Stampeding Roar is now a baseline Druid ability. Depending on your raid comp, it may not be necessary to talent {{ site.data.talent.wind_rush_totem }}.

- As kill times become faster on farm, Ancestral Reminder may be a competitive legendary to use for some bosses.
